		<h1> Hi! I’m Claire Schwimmer, a Product Manager and startup enthusiast in San Francisco</h1>
	</div>

	<div class = "body-text">
		<p>I’m currently a product manager at Google. Before that I was one of the first employees at <a href = "simplereach.com">SimpleReach</a>, a content analytics startup that I helped grow from seed through Series B funding.</p>

		<h2>Hire me!</h2>
		<p class = "job-description">I'm looking to join a mission-driven early stage startup that I can help grow.</p>
		<p class = "job-description">At SimpleReach I became an expert in getting things done with limited resources and time, doing whatever it takes to help the company succeed, and solving problems with no clear solution. At Google I’ve learned how to work at scale, how to work with multiple teams who all have competing priorities, and how to balance long term vision with short term execution.</p>

		<p class = "job-description">My experience at Google and SimpleReach have given me balanced skills:
			<ul>
				<li>Startup vs. big company - I have experience at startups from Seed to Series B as well as working at scale at Google. I know when to implement processes, how to scale them, and what they look like in their end state </li>
				<li>Execution vs. vision - I'm equally comfortable writing detailed product specs and redefining a company's organizational structure. I know when to dive into the details and execute and when to take a step back and restructure the system </li>
				<li>Data driven vs. intuition - I know when and how to implement metrics and how combine metrics and qualitative factors to make a decision.</li>
				<li>Long term vs. short term - I know how to balance short term wins with longer term success. I know when to value one over the other and ensure the longer term vision and tradeoffs are always factored into decision making</li>
				<li>and many more...
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>Here's what I've been up to</h2>

			<p class = "company-description"> I'm a <strong>Product Manager</strong> for <a href = "https://cloud.google.com/identity/solutions/secure-corp-on-personal-devices">Device Management</a> within Google Cloud Identity. We ensure company data is secure without hindering employee productivity. </p>

			<p class = "company-description">I've launched <a href = "https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/08/secure-corporate-data-on-employee-ios-devices-with-google.html">a feature</a> to prevent corporate data leaks that's used by over 1MM users and led a partnership with Android Enterprise to launch the <a href = "https://www.blog.google/products/android-enterprise/aer-emm/">Android Enterprise Recommended Program</a>, a set of recommended Device Management vendors that provide a set of required features and user experience. I'm currently leading G Suite on a joint security product to protect corporate data, launching in Q3 2019 and that's expected to be used by over 2MM users</li>

		<p class = "company-description"> SimpleReach is a content analytics platform for publishers and brands. We helped them understand their content performance and optimize their content strategy by providing holistic dashboards, actionable insights, and granular reporting.</p>


		<p class = "company-description">I joined SimpleReach as an <strong>intern</strong> in 2013 when there were 10 employees and everyone wore multiple hats. I dropped out of college after my internship because of how excited I was by what I was working on, how much I was learning, and the impact I was able to have. I left in 2018 as a <strong>Product Manager</strong> after helping the company scale to 60 employees and through Series B funding.</p>

		<p class = "company-description">Here are a few key things I worked on:
			<ul>
				<li>Managed the <strong>entire relationship</strong> for our top and most strategic customers including implementation, onboarding, training, troubleshooting, expansions, and renewals</li>
				<li><strong>Launched and grew</strong> our Paid Distribution business from <strong>$0 to millions in yearly ARR</strong>. I defined and refined all Paid Distribution processes as well as managed campaigns across platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Outbrain, and Taboola</li>
				<li>Built <strong>dashboards in Google Apps Script</strong> to monitor the health of our customers, paid distribution campaigns, and the business. These dashboards were <strong>used by all departments and were crucial to company operations</strong>, for example they were used to evaluate customer health, invoice customers, and optimize campaigns. I acted as the product manager, UX designer, and engineer.</li>
				<li><strong>Launched</strong> the market's first unified video analytics product in <a href = "https://www.adweek.com/digital/touting-distribution-and-data-cond-nast-announces-revamp-its-digital-video-platform-171237/">partnership with Conde Nast</a>. I <strong>managed the entire process</strong> from beginning to end including conducting internal and external research, defining requirements for the MVP and later versions, working with UX and engineering, validating the data collected, managing stakeholder communication, and training all teams on the product</li>
				<li>As the first Product Manager, <strong>defined and refined all Product Management processes</strong> including how we write requirements, work with engineers and designers, and train business teams</li>
			</ul>
